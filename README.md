## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run Locally

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HIMANSHU-GAUTAM123/DisasterResponse.git
cd DisasterResponse
```

### 2. **Backend Setup**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Create a .env file with your Supabase credentials:
# SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
# SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
npm start
```

### 3. **Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
# (Optional) Create a .env file for API URL:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
npm start
```

- The frontend will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- The backend will run on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
